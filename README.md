Hi, I'm Jeremy :construction_worker:!

I'm an Accountant turned Analytics Engineer. Currently Berlin-based :de:, from Singapore :singapore:. I seek to build (data) products which:

1. :loud_sound: Reduces information asymmetry.
2. :bar_chart: Enables impact through self-driven analysis.
3. :rocket: Remains performant - cost-effective, ease-of-use, and trusted.

I have the privilege of working with organisations, and on projects, which seek to drive societal good.

At the same time, I'm always on the look out for new ways to create a positive impact by building a robust data foundation/stack for analysis. If bouncing ideas around and building for change is your thing too, let's connect: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jjchia).
