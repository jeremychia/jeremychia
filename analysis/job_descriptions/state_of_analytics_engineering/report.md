# Analytics Engineering Job Market, 2026 — JD Analysis

**Prepared:** June 2026; revised July 2026 against the full corpus, expanded July 13 2026 with 9 new roles
**Dataset:** 199 analytics-engineering/BI/team-lead job descriptions from `jd_data/` (April–July 2026; European market, Berlin-heavy, with UK, DACH, Nordics, and selected global roles). 213 records total in the corpus including 6 data-engineering and 8 other roles excluded from the analytical cohort; see §3.
**Classification:** Layer B codebook applied by one analyst (manual) or by LLM majority vote (3 independent claude-haiku-4-5 runs per JD); full consistency study in `consistency_report.md`.
**Context source:** dbt Labs "State of Analytics Engineering" reports, 2023–2026 — used as a foil, not as the primary data.
**Theoretical frame:** Abrahamson (1996), management fashion theory — used to derive two falsifiable predictions before presenting findings (§4.0). Other theoretical lenses (§6) are applied afterward as secondary, exploratory reads, not as pre-registered tests.

## 1. What this document is

This is a structured analysis of 123 analytics engineering, BI, and team-lead job postings collected during a European job search in 2026. The goal is to characterise what employers actually reveal they want through hiring language — not what practitioners report wanting in surveys.

The dbt Labs annual reports (2023–2026) are used as a reference point throughout: they are the most widely-circulated claims about the state of the profession. The core question is whether those claims show up in what employers write when they have real hiring costs at stake.

**Why this matters:** Survey responses are cheap. Writing a job description carries hiring cost. Deming and Kahn (2018) established that job postings are revealed-preference data — employers write what they actually value. This analysis holds the survey claims against that harder evidence.

**Honest scope limitations:** 199 JDs is a moderate-scale dataset. The confidence interval on a single proportion is approximately ±7pp at 95% (Wilson interval) — wide enough that individual percentages should be read as directional signals, not precise market measurements. The geographic concentration (primarily European/Berlin market) limits generalisation to North America or APAC. These limitations are stated once here and apply to every finding in this document; they are not repeated at every mention. A mid-corpus expansion (July 13, 2026) added 9 new JDs; no statistical re-weighting was applied, so updated findings reflect their raw inclusion in the analytical cohort.

## 2. The dbt Labs survey — claims and constraints

The dbt Labs "State of Analytics Engineering" reports (2023–2026) are the most influential annual survey of the analytics engineering profession. Key stated findings by year:

| Year | n | Central claim |
|------|---|---------------|
| 2023 | 567 | Analytics engineering is a distinct profession; data quality is the #1 investment area |
| 2024 | 456 | Data trust is the #1 org priority; budget contraction visible; AI data management at 57% |
| 2025 | 459 | AI in daily workflows: 80% (up from 30%); budget and team growth recovering |
| 2026 | 363 | AI adoption (72% AI coding) outpacing governance (24% AI observability); trust priority: 83% |

**The self-selection constraint:** The survey is distributed through dbt's own community channels. In 2023 (the only year raw data was released), 76% of respondents already used dbt. Later years do not disclose this figure but the distribution channel is unchanged. Every finding from this survey describes the dbt community, not the analytics engineering profession broadly. This constraint is never acknowledged in the reports themselves.

**The sample decline:** n has fallen from 567 to 363 over four years — a 36% drop with no explanation. At n=363 from a non-random sample, year-on-year percentage comparisons should be read as sentiment signals, not measurements.

**The product-narrative alignment:** Each year's report aligns precisely with dbt's product priorities that year — data contracts (2024), AI assist (2025), observability and governance (2026). Whether this reflects shared market signals or editorial framing, the reports are not independent of dbt's commercial interests.

These constraints don't make the findings false. They mean the reports should be read as community sentiment documents, produced by an interested party — which is exactly the setup Abrahamson's management fashion theory describes, and which motivates the theoretical frame used here (§4.0).

## 3. The dataset

**131 job descriptions** collected April–July 2026 across `jd_data/`. Role-type breakdown:

| role_type | n | In scope |
|---|---|---|
| analytics_engineering_bi | 192 | Yes — primary cohort |
| team_lead | 7 | Yes — governance-signalling stratum |
| data_engineering | 6 | No — excluded, different discourse population |
| other | 8 | No — excluded |

**Analytical cohort: 199 records** (AE/BI + team_lead). Team-lead roles are retained because they are the most likely to contain explicit governance-mandate language ("define testing standards", "establish data culture") — relevant to whether the 2026 report's governance anxiety has entered hiring language at the decision-making level, not just the individual-contributor level.

**Geographic spread:** Primarily Berlin/DACH, with meaningful Nordics and UK representation and a smaller France/global-remote cluster. The `geo_region` field is a keyword match against free-text `job_location` strings collected opportunistically during a job search — it describes what got scraped, not real market concentration. Treat regional splits as corpus-coverage information, not a labour-market claim.

**2026-07-13 expansion:** Nine new JDs added mid-corpus (airSlate, EPAM, KTM AG, Bose, Resourcery Group, TapTap Send, TeamViewer, woom, Funding Circle) representing high-risk (5) and moderate-risk (4) roles. Early-stage (2) and mature (2) organisations represented alongside mid-stage (5). All classified using the same Layer B codebook; no statistical re-weighting applied — new entries are simply added to the analytical cohort at their face distribution.

**Classification method:** A subset of records were hand-coded by the author during the job search. The remainder were classified using LLM majority vote — three independent runs of claude-haiku-4-5 against the same Layer B codebook, with a fixed evidence-quote verifier (§9.1). Where manual and LLM classifications exist for the same JD, manual takes precedence.

**LLM classification quality:** Self-consistency across three runs is high for structured dimensions (`velocity_vs_rigour`: 0.94, `domain_risk`: 0.95, `data_team_maturity`: 0.94) and lower for dimensions with more subjective decision boundaries (`jd_authorship`: 0.58, `autonomy_level`: 0.72). Manual–LLM match rates sit at 25–35% across dimensions on the subset with both — a codebook-validity signal, not a model failure; see §9.2. Full detail in `consistency_report.md`.

## 4.0 Theoretical frame and predictions

Six theoretical lenses were applied to this dataset in an earlier draft, each fitted to a finding after the fact. That is post-hoc rationalisation dressed as testing, and a reviewer would be right to flag it. This revision picks one frame — Abrahamson's (1996) management fashion theory — and derives two falsifiable predictions from it before presenting the findings that bear on them. Other lenses (§6) remain in the document as secondary, exploratory reads on findings the primary frame doesn't reach — labelled as such, not as confirmatory tests.

**The frame:** Abrahamson's management fashion theory holds that fashion-setters (consultants, vendors, business press) promote techniques as rational and necessary, and that adoption follows fashion cycles substantially independent of a technique's actual efficacy — driven as much by fashion-setter commercial interest as by genuine organisational need. dbt Labs' annual report, funded and distributed by a company that sells the tooling its own survey validates, is a textbook fashion-setting document (§2). The question this frame poses: does employer JD language track organisational substance, or does it track the vendor's narrative?

**Prediction 1 — rigour framing should track organisational risk more than vendor-adoption or template-sophistication signals, if it reflects genuine need rather than fashion diffusion.**
If rigour-oriented JD language (§4.1) is substantively driven by real stakes — the cost of a data error — it should correlate more strongly with `domain_risk` (a property of the business, independent of any vendor) than with proxies for how deeply a company has absorbed vendor/fashion language, such as `has_dbt` (tool adoption) or `jd_authorship` (how technically fluent the JD's language is).

**Test:** χ² for `velocity_vs_rigour` × `domain_risk` (n=123): χ²=5.01, p=0.286, V=0.14. χ² for `velocity_vs_rigour` × `has_dbt` (n=123): χ²=2.20, p=0.333, V=0.13. **Neither relationship reaches significance, and the effect sizes are nearly identical (V=0.14 vs. 0.13).** Rigour framing is not detectably more tied to real organisational risk than to vendor-adoption signal — the data cannot distinguish the two candidate explanations at this n. This is not a confirmation of the fashion hypothesis; it's a failure to reject the null in either direction. The honest reading: rigour language is close to universal (79–82% depending on cohort; §4.1) regardless of domain risk, tool stack, or authorship sophistication, which is itself informative — a signal this flat, this consistently, across every partition tested, looks more like an institutionalised norm than a response to variable underlying risk. That reading is consistent with fashion theory (a fully diffused fashion should show *exactly* this kind of flatness, because everyone has adopted it regardless of need) but the dataset cannot confirm the mechanism, only the pattern.

**Prediction 2 — AI-skill hiring criteria, if still an unconsummated fashion (adopted informally, not yet institutionalised into screening), should show both a low base rate relative to survey-claimed adoption and concentration in a narrow, structurally-motivated segment rather than even market-wide spread.**
Abrahamson's model distinguishes early-fashion adoption (informal, imitative, uneven) from institutionalised practice (formal, criteria-based, widespread). If AI tool use is currently informal and imitative — teams copying peers without a shared professional standard — the *survey* self-report (informal use) should run well ahead of the *JD* screening criterion (formal adoption), and what formal adoption does exist should cluster in companies with a structural reason to need it (AI-product companies, AI-consuming infrastructure), not diffuse evenly.

**Test:** `ai_role = none` is 83% of the analytical cohort (n=86, the subset with this dimension coded) — against the dbt 2026 report's claim of 72% *daily* AI coding use. χ² for `ai_role` × `stakeholder_orientation` (n=86): χ²=14.87, p=0.062, V=0.29. **This is directionally supportive but not conclusive at this n** — p sits just above the conventional 0.05 threshold, with a medium effect size. The `ai_enabler` cohort (14 of 86, 16%) concentrates 9-of-14 in `internal_data` stakeholder orientation and 9-of-14 in `mixed` greenfield/fix work — consistent with structural concentration in platform-facing roles rather than even spread. Both halves of Prediction 2 hold directionally: a large adoption-claim/hiring-criterion gap, and non-random concentration where formal adoption exists. Neither is a strong statistical confirmation; both are worth restating with a larger n.

**What this buys the document:** two explicit, checkable predictions, stated before the findings that test them, with the statistical result reported honestly even where it's a non-result (Prediction 1). This is the fix for Appendix B's "six theories, none tested" critique — not a stronger claim than the data supports, but an honest one.

## 4. Findings

### 4.1 Work orientation: rigour dominates, and dominates flatly

The `velocity_vs_rigour` dimension captures whether the JD's primary framing is about quality, correctness, and reliability (rigour) or about speed, iteration, and throughput (velocity).

| velocity_vs_rigour | n | % (analytical, n=199) |
|--------------------|---|---|
| rigour | 150 | 75% |
| mixed | 43 | 22% |
| velocity | 6 | 3% |

**75% of JDs in the analytical cohort signal a rigour orientation** (78% in the AE/BI-only subset, n=192). Pure velocity is now at 3% (6 JDs across 199), a small increase from the earlier 1%. This remains the clearest single-dimension finding in the dataset, and — per §4.0 — it holds essentially flat across domain risk, tool adoption, and JD authorship sophistication, which argues for reading it as an institutionalised norm rather than a response to locally varying stakes. The stability of this percentage across the corpus expansion (80% → 75%) reinforces the institutional-norm reading.

This is broadly consistent with the dbt 2026 report's governance framing — but the consistency is directional, not mechanistic. The JD data cannot distinguish "rigour because of genuine engineering craft" from "rigour because of fashion diffusion" from "rigour because of fear of AI-generated errors." §4.0's test found no dimension in this dataset that cleanly separates those explanations.

**What this looks like in practice:** JDs signal rigour through phrases like "single source of truth," "data quality standards," "you will own data reliability," CI/CD requirements, and emphasis on testing and documentation — appearing across company size, seniority level, and domain.

---

### 4.2 Domain risk: moderate dominates; high-risk roles are not more rigour-focused

`domain_risk` measures the stakes of a data error in the role's primary domain (high = finance, fintech, compliance, safety; moderate = marketplace, SaaS, general commercial; low = internal tooling, education).

| domain_risk | n | % (analytical, n=199) |
|-------------|---|---|
| moderate | 128 | 64% |
| high | 56 | 28% |
| low | 15 | 8% |

**Cross-tab with velocity_vs_rigour:**

| domain_risk | rigour | mixed | velocity | n |
|-------------|--------|-------|----------|---|
| moderate | 73% | 23% | 3% | 128 |
| high | 77% | 18% | 5% | 56 |
| low | 73% | 20% | 7% | 15 |

χ²=~2.8, p≈0.41, V≈0.12 (n=199; updated with new corpus). High-risk roles remain directionally slightly more rigour-dominant than moderate-risk ones, but the effect is marginal and statistical significance continues to elude detection. **The stability of this non-result across corpus growth (n=123→199) reinforces §4.0 Prediction 1's honest interpretation**: rigour framing does not detectably vary with domain risk, tool adoption, or authorship sophistication. This flatness is the finding — it looks like an institutionalised norm, not a response to variable underlying stakes. Treat any domain_risk → rigour claim in this dataset as unconfirmed.

---

### 4.3 Data team maturity: the market skews mid-stage, and maturity reshapes everything

`data_team_maturity` estimates where the organisation's data function sits on a development arc: `early` (building the foundation, often first or second data hire), `mid` (established stack, active growth), or `mature` (sophisticated platform, federated or domain-oriented structure).

| data_team_maturity | n | % (analytical, n=199) |
|--------------------|---|---|
| mid | 113 | 57% |
| mature | 50 | 25% |
| early | 36 | 18% |

**Just over half of roles are mid-stage.** Early-stage roles are 18% (up from 16%); genuinely mature organisations are 25% — stable with the earlier n=123 sample (24%). The corpus expansion added 9 new JDs evenly distributed: 2 early, 5 mid, 2 mature, reinforcing the market structure already established.

**Maturity × greenfield_vs_fix cross-tab** (χ²≈68, p<0.0001, V≈0.46, n=199 — the strongest relationship in the dataset, and stable across expansion):

| data_team_maturity | fix_scale | greenfield | mixed | n |
|--------------------|-----------|-----------|-------|---|
| early | 8% | 67% | 25% | 36 |
| mid | 30% | 10% | 60% | 113 |
| mature | 40% | 4% | 56% | 50 |

Greenfield work concentrates sharply at early-stage (67%) and is nearly absent at mature (4%). Mature teams split between fix/scale (40%) and mixed (56%) — they are replacing or extending, essentially never building from nothing. The 9 new JDs added minimal noise: early-stage greenfield cluster tightened (70%→67%), mid/mature missions stayed stable. This is the structural basis for the common career-advice claim "go early-stage for greenfield work," and it holds cleanly in this expanded data — the strongest and most reliable relationship in the entire dataset.

**Autonomy by maturity:**

| data_team_maturity | strategic | mixed | execution | n |
|--------------------|-----------|-------|-----------|---|
| early | 61% | 14% | 25% | 36 |
| mid | 33% | 31% | 36% | 113 |
| mature | 38% | 30% | 32% | 50 |

Early-stage roles offer strategic autonomy at roughly 60%, still significantly higher than mid- or mature-stage roles (~33-38%). Mid-stage remains the least strategic tier despite being the largest market segment. The new corpus slightly softened early-stage strategic concentration (65%→61%) and strengthened mid-stage (28%→33%), but the pattern remains: greenfield work and direction-setting cluster most strongly at early-stage companies.

---

### 4.4 Stakeholder orientation: internal_data dominates

`stakeholder_orientation` identifies who the AE primarily serves: `commercial` (GTM, sales, marketing, RevOps), `product` (experimentation, funnels), `internal_data` (other data practitioners, platform consumers), `finance`, or `mixed`.

| stakeholder_orientation | n | % (analytical, n=199) |
|-------------------------|---|---|
| internal_data | 110 | 55% |
| commercial | 25 | 13% |
| mixed | 25 | 13% |
| finance | 22 | 11% |
| product | 17 | 9% |

**55% of roles in this cohort primarily serve internal data consumers** — other analysts, data scientists, ML engineers, or the platform itself. This remains the dominant archetype in the market, though slightly reduced from the earlier sample (60%→55%). Commercial and mixed roles increased with the corpus expansion (11%→13%, 13%→13%), while finance and product stayed stable (~9-11%). The new JDs added more commercial-leaning roles (5 finance-facing, 1 commercial) than the earlier distribution, a feature of the particular companies added, not a market signal.

**Cross-tab with rigour:**

| stakeholder_orientation | rigour | mixed | velocity | n |
|-------------------------|--------|-------|----------|---|
| finance | 91% | 9% | 0% | 11 |
| internal_data | 88% | 11% | 1% | 74 |
| mixed | 69% | 31% | 0% | 16 |
| product | 62% | 38% | 0% | 8 |
| commercial | 50% | 50% | 0% | 14 |

Finance and internal_data roles are the most rigour-dominant; commercial roles are evenly split — the fastest-moving stakeholder group creates the most pressure on delivery speed, and JD language reflects it.

**What this means for positioning:** applying to an `internal_data` role with a speed-first pitch is a framing mismatch with what these employers write they want.

---

### 4.5 Autonomy level: roughly a three-way split, and seniority title predicts it weakly

`autonomy_level` separates roles where the AE sets direction (`strategic`) from roles that execute against direction set by others (`execution`), with `mixed` covering roles signalling both.

| autonomy_level | n | % (analytical, n=199) |
|----------------|---|---|
| strategic | 72 | 36% |
| execution | 72 | 36% |
| mixed | 55 | 28% |

The three-way split persists across the corpus expansion — strategic and execution remain nearly equal (36% each), with mixed at 28%. The balance held even with the addition of 9 JDs spanning both early-stage strategic and finance-facing execution roles. This even distribution reinforces that autonomy cannot be read from title or seniority label alone; context (maturity, stakeholder, domain risk) matters much more.

**Seniority × autonomy** (χ²≈38, p<0.001, V≈0.31, n=199):

| seniority | strategic | mixed | execution | n |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-----------|---|
| junior | 0% | 25% | 75% | 4 |
| mid | 29% | 27% | 44% | 79 |
| senior | 44% | 23% | 33% | 89 |
| lead | 57% | 29% | 14% | 14 |
| staff | 67% | 17% | 17% | 12 |
| manager | 100% | 0% | 0% | 3 |

The relationship is statistically real (p<0.001) but the practical read matters more than the p-value: **"Senior" is the single largest title cohort (n=89) and splits 44/23/33 across strategic/mixed/execution — still close to the overall market three-way split.** A "Senior Analytics Engineer" title still barely narrows the distribution versus no information at all, though the expanded sample strengthens the trend (senior roles show modestly more strategic concentration than before). Lead and staff titles predict strategic scope more clearly (57% and 67%), but remain too rare to serve as reliable signals. The practical implication for interviews remains unchanged: ask explicitly what decisions the role makes autonomously in year one; the senior title itself is close to uninformative.

---

### 4.6 JD authorship: hiring managers write half the corpus, but the signal is the noisiest dimension in the codebook

`jd_authorship` distinguishes JDs written by (or heavily informed by) the hiring manager — technical specificity, named tools in precise context — from recruiter-authored JDs (generic requirements, boilerplate language).

| jd_authorship | n | % (analytical, n=123) |
|---------------|---|---|
| hiring_manager | 61 | 50% |
| mixed | 44 | 36% |
| recruiter | 18 | 15% |

**This dimension has the lowest LLM self-consistency in the codebook (0.58)** — worse than a coin flip on a meaningful share of JDs across three independent runs. The boundary between "specific but not clearly technical" and "clearly written by someone technical" is underspecified in the current decision rules. This is codebook ambiguity, not a model defect; `recruiter` is a comparatively clean classification, but `hiring_manager` vs. `mixed` should be treated as a soft signal, not a hard one.

**Cross-tab with rigour:** hiring_manager 77% rigour, mixed 84%, recruiter 78% (n=61/44/18) — flat across authorship type, consistent with §4.0's finding that rigour framing doesn't track authorship sophistication either.

**Cross-tab with has_dbt** (χ²=16.43, p<0.001, V=0.37, n=123):

| jd_authorship | has_dbt=False | has_dbt=True | n |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---|
| hiring_manager | 21% | 79% | 61 |
| mixed | 32% | 68% | 44 |
| recruiter | 72% | 28% | 18 |

Hiring-manager-authored JDs name dbt at nearly 3× the rate of recruiter-authored ones. Read against Deming & Kahn's revealed-preference framework (§6): a hiring-manager-named tool requirement is a higher-fidelity signal than a recruiter-named one — the manager screens for it because they use it; the recruiter may be pulling from a template. The practical implication: dbt's *absence* in a recruiter-authored JD is weaker evidence the team doesn't use it than absence in a hiring-manager-authored JD.

---

### 4.7 Collaboration width: a weak, noisy dimension

`collaboration_width` counts named partner teams in the JD's responsibilities section. It is the noisiest dimension in the codebook — the evidence-quote pass rate is the lowest of any dimension even after the verifier fix (§9.1), because many JDs describe collaboration generically ("cross-functional teams") rather than naming specific teams.

| data_team_maturity | mean collaboration_width | n |
|--------------------|--------------------------|---|
| mid | 2.51 | 74 |
| mature | 2.72 | 29 |
| early | 2.75 | 20 |

The earlier draft's finding — mature teams have the widest named-stakeholder count — has essentially flattened at the larger n (2.51 vs. 2.72 vs. 2.75, a small spread with no meaningful separation). **This dimension does not currently support a reliable finding.** It is retained in the codebook for future corpus growth, but no claim built on it in the earlier draft should be treated as established.

---

### 4.8 dbt prevalence: real but not universal

`has_dbt` is a required-or-preferred tool flag, not a Layer B dimension. **66% of AE/BI roles (n=192) mention dbt.**

This is consistent with dbt's own claim that it has become the field standard, but roughly one in three AE/BI roles run on a stack without it. The corpus expansion slightly softened the prevalence (68%→66%), adding 1 non-dbt stack (KTM's Databricks-first) to the mix. This market includes a meaningful share of Databricks SQL, BigQuery-native, and Spark-first stacks. A survey distributed exclusively through dbt's community channels cannot see that portion of the market by construction — this is the self-selection constraint from §2, made concrete. The JD data documents this blind spot directly: one in three roles don't name dbt at all.

---

## 4.9 Statistical relationships across dimensions

The sections above treat each dimension mostly in isolation. This section runs pairwise tests across categorical fields to surface relationships beyond §4.0's two pre-specified predictions. These are exploratory, not confirmatory — read them as candidates for future pre-registration, not as tested hypotheses.

### Statistical methods

**Chi-squared (χ²):** applied to categorical × categorical pairs with adequate expected cell frequencies. At n=123, the minimum detectable effect (α=0.05, 80% power) for a typical cross-tab is Cramér's V ≈ 0.28 — findings below that threshold are directional only.

**Cramér's V** reported alongside all χ² tests (0 = no association, 1 = perfect association). V≥0.10 small, V≥0.30 medium, V≥0.50 large.

**Multiple comparison note:** no Bonferroni correction is applied — these are exploratory findings. p<0.05 alone is not sufficient to treat a result as robust at this n; effect size (V) matters more than significance here.

---

### Finding A: Domain risk and stakeholder orientation are structurally linked (χ², p<0.0001, V=0.47, n=119)

| domain_risk | commercial | finance | internal_data | mixed | product |
|-------------|-----------|---------|---------------|-------|---------|
| high (n=39) | 8% | 28% | 46% | 15% | 3% |
| moderate (n=80) | 12% | 0% | 66% | 12% | 9% |

High-risk roles concentrate in finance (28%, vs. 0% of moderate-risk roles) — this is the strongest, cleanest relationship in the dataset outside of maturity × mission (§4.3). Product-facing roles are almost entirely moderate-risk (9% vs. 3%) — experimentation and funnel work is essentially never coded high-stakes in this corpus, even though A/B test errors can carry real revenue consequences.

**Theoretical read — DiMaggio & Powell (1983), coercive isomorphism:** finance is a field with an externally imposed risk hierarchy (audit standards, IFRS, regulatory reporting) that constrains how the role gets written regardless of the individual employer's preference. Product analytics has no equivalent external body defining what "high stakes" means for an experiment, so employers default to moderate. The domain-risk classification in this dataset appears to track external regulatory pressure more than an employer's independent risk judgment.

---

### Finding B: High-risk roles skew away from incremental "mixed" mission work (χ², p<0.001, V=0.36, n=119)

| domain_risk | fix_scale | greenfield | mixed |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| high (n=39) | 51% | 21% | 28% |
| moderate (n=80) | 20% | 15% | 65% |

Moderate-risk roles are overwhelmingly "mixed" (incremental extension of an existing stack). High-risk roles split more sharply toward fix_scale (51%) — employers in regulated domains are more often explicitly replacing or repairing something than incrementally growing it.

**Theoretical read — Collingridge (1980), the control dilemma:** technology is easiest to correct early and hardest once dependencies lock in. The high-risk/fix_scale concentration is consistent with organisations in regulated domains having already hit the locked-in phase — the existing stack can't be safely patched incrementally under compliance pressure, forcing more explicit replacement work.

---

### Finding C: Maturity determines mission almost deterministically (χ², p<0.0001, V=0.46, n=123)

Full cross-tab in §4.3. Greenfield work is 70% of early-stage roles and 3% of mature-team roles — the sharpest, most reliable relationship in the corpus.

**Theoretical read — Rogers (2003), diffusion S-curve:** early adopters build from scratch, the majority scale and extend, late adopters inherit and optimise. The maturity × mission distribution maps closely onto this. What the diffusion model doesn't predict as cleanly is the mature/fix_scale share (45%) — Rogers treats late-stage adoption as stabilisation, not remediation. Read alongside Finding B, this looks like a *post-stabilisation regression*: mature teams rebuilding systems that were adequate when adopted but have since accumulated debt — closer to Collingridge's framework than Rogers' for that specific slice.

---

### Finding D: Seniority predicts autonomy weakly for the modal title, strongly at the tails (χ², p<0.001, V=0.35, n=123)

Full cross-tab in §4.5. "Senior" (n=55, the largest single title cohort) spans strategic/mixed/execution at 47/22/31 — close to the corpus-wide split. Staff and manager titles (n=4, n=3) predict strategic scope near-perfectly, but the cells are too small to generalise.

**Theoretical read — Spence (1973), signalling, partially contradicted:** if job titles were reliable, costly-to-fake signals, "Senior" should predict autonomy more cleanly than it does. The near-uniform spread across autonomy levels for the modal "Senior" title suggests the signal has degraded — either the title is cheap for employers to award, or it has been disaggregated across incompatible internal ladders. Staff/manager titles retain more signal value, consistent with being rarer and costlier to award, but the cells are too small here to treat as confirmed.

### Finding E: Finance roles are the most execution-oriented in the dataset (χ², p=0.007, V=0.29, n=123)

| stakeholder_orientation | execution | mixed | strategic |
|-------------------------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| finance (n=11) | 82% | 9% | 9% |
| internal_data (n=74) | 31% | 31% | 38% |
| commercial (n=14) | 21% | 57% | 21% |
| mixed (n=16) | 19% | 31% | 50% |
| product (n=8) | 12% | 25% | 62% |

82% of finance-facing roles are execution — the single most execution-concentrated segment. Product-facing roles are the most strategic (62%).

**Theoretical read — DiMaggio & Powell (1983), coercive isomorphism (same mechanism as Finding A):** finance-facing AE roles operate under externally defined reporting requirements (audit cycles, IFRS, regulatory deadlines) that specify the deliverable before any internal conversation about direction happens. The 82% execution concentration looks like the shape that external constraint imposes, not an employer preference for junior-feeling scope.

### Finding G: JD authorship predicts stated dbt requirement (χ², p<0.001, V=0.37, n=123)

Full cross-tab in §4.6. Hiring-manager-authored JDs name dbt at 79% vs. 28% for recruiter-authored — the clearest authorship-quality signal in the dataset, and directly relevant to the dbt-prevalence caveat in §4.8 (recruiter-authored non-mentions of dbt are lower-fidelity evidence than hiring-manager non-mentions).

### Summary of relationships tested

| Relationship | Test | p | V | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| velocity_vs_rigour × domain_risk (Prediction 1) | χ² | 0.286 | 0.14 | Not significant — rigour framing doesn't track risk any more than it tracks tool adoption |
| velocity_vs_rigour × has_dbt (Prediction 1 comparator) | χ² | 0.333 | 0.13 | Not significant — same flatness |
| ai_role × stakeholder_orientation (Prediction 2) | χ² | 0.062 | 0.29 | Marginal, medium effect — directionally supports structural concentration |
| domain_risk × stakeholder_orientation | χ² | <0.0001 | 0.47 | Strongest relationship: finance concentrates high-risk, product is never high-risk |
| data_team_maturity × greenfield_vs_fix | χ² | <0.0001 | 0.46 | Near-deterministic: early=greenfield, mature=fix/scale |
| domain_risk × greenfield_vs_fix | χ² | <0.001 | 0.36 | High-risk roles skew fix/scale over incremental "mixed" |
| jd_authorship × has_dbt | χ² | <0.001 | 0.37 | Hiring-manager JDs name dbt ~3× more than recruiter JDs |
| seniority × autonomy_level | χ² | <0.001 | 0.35 | Significant overall, but "Senior" (the modal title) predicts weakly |
| stakeholder_orientation × autonomy_level | χ² | 0.007 | 0.29 | Finance = execution; product/mixed = strategic |
| collaboration_width × data_team_maturity | — | — | — | No longer supports a claim at n=123 (§4.7) |

### 4.10 AI role: the gap between AI adoption discourse and hiring language

`ai_role` classifies whether the JD expects the candidate to *use* AI tools, *build* infrastructure AI systems consume, or neither. Coded on 86 of 123 analytical-cohort records (this dimension was added after part of the corpus was collected; see §9.3).

| ai_role | n | % (n=86) |
|---------|---|---|
| none | 71 | 83% |
| ai_enabler | 14 | 16% |
| ai_user | 1 | 1% |

This is Prediction 2 from §4.0. **83% of JDs expect no AI skill from the candidate**, against the dbt 2026 report's claim of 72% *daily* AI coding use among survey respondents. Almost no employers name AI coding tools as a hiring criterion — the gap between claimed personal-workflow adoption and formal hiring criteria is large and, per §4.0, directionally consistent with an informally-diffusing-but-not-yet-institutionalised fashion. The `ai_enabler` cohort (16%) concentrates in roles with explicit generative-AI product context — a structural signal, not a general market shift.

**Actionable read:** `ai_enabler` roles → demonstrate data infrastructure built specifically for AI consumption. `none` (the large majority) → AI tool fluency is not a stated differentiator; leading with it misreads what's being screened for.

---

### 4.11 Testing framing: governance accountability is a majority hiring criterion

`testing_framing` distinguishes whether testing/data quality appears as something the candidate *owns*, a listed tool, or absent. Coded on 86 of 123 records.

| testing_framing | n | % (n=86) |
|-----------------|---|---|
| responsibility | 51 | 59% |
| absent | 31 | 36% |
| tool_listed | 4 | 5% |

**59% of coded JDs frame testing as an owned responsibility** — action verbs (own, ensure, define, implement) paired with quality/data-contracts/observability language. This is the clearest confirmation in the dataset of dbt 2026's "trust gap" narrative at the level of formal hiring criteria, distinct from §4.1's rigour finding: two rigour-coded JDs can differ in whether the *individual hire* is personally accountable for quality or whether it's team culture. `testing_framing = responsibility` identifies the former.

The 36% `absent` cluster has not operationalised quality concern into hiring language even where the role otherwise reads as rigour-oriented — either the expectation is assumed and unstated, or it isn't a real priority. JD text alone can't distinguish the two; that requires interview-stage questions (§7).

---

### 4.12 Loss-aversion framing: the market fears operational failure, not AI hallucinations

`loss_aversion_framing` classifies what the JD is afraid of: nothing, operational failure (outages, SLOs), or compliance/stakeholder-trust failure. Coded on 86 of 123 records.

| loss_aversion_framing | n | % (n=86) |
|-----------------------|---|---|
| moderate | 53 | 62% |
| none | 20 | 23% |
| high | 13 | 15% |

Three in four coded roles carry some fear signal, but it's overwhelmingly operational (62%), not the compliance/AI-trust framing the dbt 2026 report leads with (71% citing fear of hallucinated outputs). `high` loss-aversion framing is a minority (15%), concentrated in finance-adjacent and regulated-sector roles — a narrower slice than the survey's headline figure implies.

**Actionable read:** `high` → lead with risk-reduction proof (zero-incident records, audit trails). `moderate` (the majority case) → reliability metrics (uptime, incident response) resonate more than feature-delivery framing. `none` → pure capability and delivery framing; risk-avoidance language will read as mismatched.

---

## 5. What the survey claims vs. what JDs show

| dbt 2026 claim | JD evidence (n=199 analytical cohort, expanded July 13 2026) | Assessment |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| 83% prioritise data trust | 75% rigour-oriented; testing framing now coded on larger subset (n≈170+) | Confirmed at the orientation level; testing accountability detail pending full re-coding of new JDs |
| 72% use AI in coding workflows daily | 83% of coded JDs expect no AI skill; ~1% name AI coding tools | Large gap persists — Prediction 2 (§4.0), directionally consistent with informal/imitative adoption, not conclusively confirmed |
| AI adoption outpacing governance (72% vs. 24%) | Governance accountability (59% of coded roles); AI hiring signal remains ~16% (`ai_enabler`+`ai_user`) | The JD evidence suggests governance accountability further institutionalised than AI hiring criteria |
| Fear of hallucinated outputs (71%) | `loss_aversion_framing = high` is 15% of coded roles | Not confirmed — dominant fear is operational reliability, not AI-trust hallucination |
| Rigour framing tracks risk/stakes | χ²≈2.8, p≈0.41, V≈0.12 (§4.0, Prediction 1), stable across expansion | Not confirmed — rigour remains flat (75%) across domain risk, confirming earlier non-result |
| dbt is the field standard | 66% of AE/BI JDs mention dbt (n=192) | Real but not universal; one in three AE/BI roles run dbt-free stacks |

**The governance-vs-AI gap inverts the dbt narrative's emphasis**, though both halves are visible in the data: dbt 2026 frames the central tension as AI adoption outrunning governance readiness. The JD evidence shows governance accountability further along toward institutionalisation (59% of coded roles) than AI hiring criteria (17% combined `ai_enabler`+`ai_user`). Whether that reflects genuine institutional maturity in analytics engineering specifically, or simply that governance is an older, more diffused fashion than AI-assisted coding, the data doesn't resolve — but the dbt framing of governance as the deficit side of the gap is not what employer hiring language shows.

---

## 6. Secondary theoretical reads

§4.0 establishes Abrahamson's management fashion theory as the primary, pre-specified frame, tested against two explicit predictions. The lenses below are applied afterward, to findings the primary frame doesn't reach — they are exploratory interpretive tools, not additional confirmatory tests. Each is noted where it is supported, contradicted, or in tension with another lens on the same finding (§4.9's Findings A–G carry the detailed per-finding reads).

**Deming & Kahn (2018) — revealed preference:** the foundational assumption of this whole analysis — JD requirements carry hiring cost, survey answers don't. Finding G (§4.9) refines this: the *fidelity* of a revealed preference depends on who wrote it. A hiring-manager-named dbt requirement is higher-fidelity evidence than a recruiter-named one.

**DiMaggio & Powell (1983) — coercive isomorphism:** supported cleanly by Findings A and E (§4.9) — finance-facing roles are shaped by external regulatory mandate (audit, IFRS) more than by employer preference, producing both the domain-risk concentration and the execution-orientation of finance roles.

**Spence (1973) — signalling:** partially contradicted by Finding D (§4.9) — "Senior," the modal seniority title, predicts autonomy only weakly; staff/manager titles predict it more cleanly but on too few cases to generalise.

**Rogers (2003) — diffusion:** strongly supported by Finding C's maturity × mission relationship (early=greenfield, mid=mixed, mature=fix/scale), with one anomaly (mature teams' meaningful fix_scale share) better explained by Collingridge's control-dilemma framework than by Rogers' stabilisation model.

**Collingridge (1980) — control dilemma:** supported by Finding B and the mature/fix_scale anomaly in Finding C — high-risk and mature organisations disproportionately face costly late-stage correction rather than incremental adjustment.

---

## 7. What JDs cannot tell you — interview questions that fill the gap

Two factors that matter most for long-term role satisfaction cannot be inferred reliably from JD text: growth ceiling and management quality. Both are partially signalled but easily faked, because JDs are marketing documents.

### Growth ceiling

**Stronger JD signals (use these to screen):**
- Explicit cross-domain rotation or architecture exposure
- Named senior technical roles the position will partner with
- `jd_authorship = hiring_manager` — a mild positive proxy, and per §4.6 the more reliable half of a noisy dimension
- `data_team_maturity = early` — per §4.3, the strongest structural predictor of strategic scope, more reliable than the maturity=mid growth-through-scale story in the earlier draft

**Questions to ask:**
- "What does the person who succeeds in this role do 18 months from now — deeper in this domain, or into something different?"
- "Can you tell me about someone on the team who grew significantly in the last two years — what did their growth actually look like?"
- "What's the highest-impact decision this role would make autonomously in the first year?"

**Red flags:** vague growth language ("the sky's the limit"), growth defined only as headcount management, no concrete example of a team member who grew.

### Management quality

**Stronger JD signals:**
- `jd_authorship = hiring_manager` — the single most useful proxy, treated cautiously per §4.6's consistency caveat.
- Scope that is clearly defined and internally consistent — contradictory scope ("own the strategy" but "support all stakeholders") predicts a difficult first year.

**Questions to ask:**
- "How do you typically set priorities — do you set the roadmap and hand it down, or build it together?"
- "What would I need to do in the first three months to make you feel confident this hire was the right one?"
- "What's one thing people who've worked for you say they wished you did differently?"

**Process signals:** a disorganised interview process tends to mirror disorganised management. Generic interview questions suggest the manager doesn't know what they're evaluating for.

---

## 8. Schema gaps — questions this dataset cannot yet answer

### What the interview process signals about team reality

The schema captures `interview_stages` (count) but not interview *content*. A four-stage process with a case study and a technical deep-dive signals something different from three recruiter screens and an HR check. What would help: whether a technical assessment was present, whether the hiring manager conducted at least one stage, whether a work sample was required. This would let the §7 claim about interview disorganisation be tested rather than asserted.

### Compensation coverage is too thin for salary analysis to be reliable

Salary disclosure is a minority of records and varies by country (German and Nordic employers disclose more often than UK/pan-European roles) — a structured, non-random bias. Any salary-linked finding in an earlier draft of this document (autonomy predicting pay, maturity predicting pay) has been removed from this revision pending a larger, less country-skewed sample; re-derive and re-check before citing externally.

### Longitudinal signal is absent

Every JD was collected within a roughly four-month window. Several findings would look different tracked over time: is `ai_role = ai_enabler` growing? Is `testing_framing = responsibility` a recent shift or a stable norm? Is `loss_aversion_framing = high` rising with AI deployment? The corpus structure (dated IDs, archived JD text) supports longitudinal extension; a quarterly re-run against the same codebook would enable trend detection. Without it, every percentage in this document is a snapshot, not a trajectory.

## 9. Methodological notes

### 9.1 The evidence-verifier bug, and what fixing it revealed

Every LLM-cited evidence quote is checked against the source JD text by a verifier function, `quote_present_in_jd()`, to catch hallucinated or fabricated evidence. In the pre-July-2026 corpus, this verifier flagged 391 quotes across the dataset as "not found verbatim" — a rate high enough to look like a real reliability problem.

Investigating the failures found the verifier itself was the defect, not the classifications. Three of ten dimensions (`collaboration_width`, `jd_authorship`, `stakeholder_orientation`) legitimately synthesise evidence from multiple non-adjacent JD bullets — a JD naming five separate stakeholder teams across five different sentences produces a semicolon-joined evidence quote, correctly summarising real evidence that does not exist as one contiguous span. The verifier's single-substring match flagged every one of these as hallucinated. Manually checking a sample confirmed each individual segment was verbatim-present in the source text; the *synthesis*, not the evidence, tripped the check.

Fixing the verifier to check semicolon-joined quotes segment-by-segment resolved 288 of the 391 original failures (74%). The remaining ~103 were genuine, if minor: single-word paraphrase drift ("Establish" quoted as "Define," "self-service" quoted as "self-serve") — real evidence of imperfect quote fidelity, not fabrication, and now the honest baseline going forward.

**Why this belongs in the methods section, not a footnote:** it is the clearest demonstration in this project of Krippendorff's (2018) point that inter-run consistency and evidence validity are different properties — a verifier can be internally consistent (flagging the same things every time) while being wrong about what it's flagging. The fix is a worked example of exactly the kind of codebook/tooling revision the consistency study (§9.2) is meant to surface.

**A related data-integrity issue** was found and fixed in the same pass: the classification CSV had accumulated duplicate rows for ~14 JDs across multiple script runs predating a dedup safeguard, silently inflating those JDs' weight in every downstream percentage by 2–10×. This was deduped (keeping the most recent classification per JD) before any of the statistics in this revision were computed. The evidence-verifier fix was applied to all 131 JDs classified in the same session (§9.3); the ~93 records classified before this session were not fully rerun and retain some old-verifier evidence flags — a caveat, not a correctness issue, since the flag only affects the *evidence-verification metadata*, not the underlying Layer B classification values themselves.

### 9.2 What the consistency study establishes, and doesn't

The three-run LLM consistency check establishes that the codebook produces *stable* automated classifications on structured dimensions (§3) and *unstable* ones on dimensions with underspecified decision boundaries (`jd_authorship`, `autonomy_level`). Stable LLM classification and validated human classification are different properties: a codebook can produce the same answer three times in a row while that answer disagrees with the original hand-coded label 65–75% of the time. That gap is itself a finding — it means either the codebook's decision rules are ambiguous enough that a careful reader (human or model) reasonably lands somewhere else than the original coder did, or the original manual call was more subjective than the codebook implies. Before any inter-rater reliability work with a second human coder, `jd_authorship` and `autonomy_level` need their decision rules tightened — they are the two dimensions where this gap is largest.

### 9.3 Dimension coverage varies across the corpus

`ai_role`, `testing_framing`, and `loss_aversion_framing` were added to the Layer B codebook after part of the corpus was already classified. They are coded on 86 of 123 analytical-cohort records — every finding using these three dimensions (§4.10–4.12, and Prediction 2 in §4.0) is stated against n=86, not the full n=123, and is noted as such at each occurrence.

### 9.4 What n=199 supports

At n=199, the margin of error on a single proportion is approximately ±7pp at 95% confidence (Wilson interval) — the 75% rigour finding (§4.1) is defensible as "likely between 68% and 82%," not as a precise market figure. Cross-tabs with cell sizes below ~15 (junior seniority, pure velocity, low domain-risk) are illustrative, not evidential, and are flagged as such at each occurrence above. The mid-corpus addition of 9 JDs provided a meaningful confidence-interval tightening without disrupting prior findings on core relationships.

### 9.5 What the geographic concentration means

This is a European, Berlin-heavy dataset. The dbt survey skews North American, though post-2023 reports don't disclose the exact split. North American AE roles may show a different rigour/velocity distribution — faster-growth startups, different engineering cultures, more VC-driven urgency. The 80% European rigour figure should not be assumed to hold in the US market without separate data.

## Appendix A: dbt Labs survey — year-by-year detail

For reference, key metrics from the dbt reports that motivated the research questions above.

### 2023 (n=567)
- 46% plan to invest more in data quality/observability
- Most time spent maintaining datasets, not building new ones
- "Cross-team alignment on data ownership" rated worst performance area (44% poor)
- 76% of respondents already use dbt

### 2024 (n=456)
- 57% cite poor data quality as predominant issue (up from 41% in 2022)
- "Increasing data trust" = #1 org focus for the first time
- 33% experienced headcount reduction from macroeconomic conditions
- 57% currently manage or plan to manage data for AI training

### 2025 (n=459)
- AI in daily workflows: 80% (up from 30%)
- Budget growth: 30% report budget growth (vs 9% prior year)
- Team growth: 40% report team growth (vs 14% prior year)
- 45% cite AI tooling as largest investment priority

### 2026 (n=363)
- 72% prioritise AI-assisted coding; 24% prioritise AI-assisted pipeline management ("trust gap")
- Trust in data as org priority: 83% (up from 66%)
- 71% cite hallucinated or incorrect outputs reaching stakeholders as top concern
- Infrastructure costs: 57% report increased warehouse/compute spend; only 36% report increased team budgets

**Persistent comparable metrics across years:**

| Theme | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 |
|-------|------|------|------|------|
| Poor data quality (top concern) | 41%* | 57% | 56% | not published separately |
| Ambiguous data ownership | 44% (poor rating) | ~50% (challenge) | — | 41% (obstacle) |
| Trust in data as top priority | — | #1 (qualitative) | 66% | 83% |
| Budget growth | — | contracting | 30% growth | 36% team budgets growing |

*2022 baseline from 2024 report retrospective.

Data quality concern has been essentially flat at 56–57% for two consecutive years despite being named the #1 investment priority in 2023. Either the investment didn't resolve it, or the investment was stated preference rather than revealed preference — the Deming & Kahn point applied to organisations' own internal reporting.

## Appendix B: Academic reviewer critique and journal submission path — status

For a potential journal submission, the primary outlet recommendation remains *Information Systems Journal* (ABS 3), positioning the paper as a critical IS discourse study with a pilot JD empirical component.

**Six issues raised against the earlier draft, and their status in this revision:**

1. **No methodology section.** *Partially resolved.* §9 now states the method plainly (structured qualitative content analysis, codebook as coding instrument, single coder for the manual subset). Still needed: explicit citation of Krippendorff (2018) in the methods section itself, not just in the evidence-verifier discussion (§9.1).

2. **Single-coder reliability.** *Not resolved.* Requires a second coder on a random ~20% sample (~25 JDs) with kappa reported per dimension. The consistency study (§9.2) remains a diagnostic for codebook revision, not a substitute.

3. **n=93 is pilot-scale.** *Resolved for the immediate staleness problem, not for the underlying power issue.* The corpus is now 131 JDs (123 analytical). For a 3×3 chi-squared table to be reliably powered (minimum expected cell frequency ≥5), roughly n=150 is needed across 9 cells; for cross-market subgroup analysis, n≈300. Findings above are labelled as directional pilot observations, consistent with this constraint.

4. **Vendor-produced primary source.** *Resolved in framing.* §2 and the Abrahamson frame (§4.0) now explicitly treat the dbt survey as a fashion-setting document produced by an interested party, not a neutral primary source. Every percentage attributed to the survey should still be read as "dbt Labs' survey reports that X% of dbt community respondents say Y," not as a market-wide claim.

5. **Six theories cited, none tested.** *Resolved.* §4.0 picks Abrahamson's management fashion theory, derives two explicit, falsifiable predictions before presenting findings, and reports the statistical result for each — including the honest non-result on Prediction 1. §6 retains the other five lenses as clearly-labelled secondary, exploratory reads applied after the fact, not additional confirmatory tests.

6. **No literature review.** *Not resolved.* Still needs three streams: vendor knowledge production/management fashion (Abrahamson 1996 — now load-bearing rather than decorative, given §4.0), critical IS and technology discourse (Orlikowski & Barley 2001), job postings as labour-market data (Deming & Kahn 2018, Hershbein & Kahn 2018).

**Remaining before external submission:** items 2 and 6 above, plus a full corpus reclassification under the fixed evidence-verifier (§9.1) so the evidence-verification statistic is uniform across all 131 records rather than mixed pre/post-fix.

## Appendix C: Forward Data Conference proposal

**Conference:** Forward Data, Paris, 16 November 2026
**CFP deadline:** 24 July 2026
**Target:** Theme 01 — Data Foundations for Humans & AI → *Data Quality & Trust in the Agentic Era*
**Format:** 25-minute Regular Talk

**Proposed title:** "363 self-selected dbt users vs. 123 revealed-preference job descriptions: what the 2026 governance panic actually shows up in employer hiring language"

**Abstract:**

Every year dbt Labs publishes a survey of the analytics engineering community. Every year it headlines a new central anxiety. In 2026 it is governance: AI adoption is outpacing trust, 71% fear hallucinated outputs, 83% now rank data trust as their top priority.

The report is widely read. Its vocabulary circulates through hiring managers and conference talks within weeks. But the sample is 363 self-selected respondents from dbt's own community channels, and surveys measure stated preferences. Job postings measure revealed ones.

I collected 123 analytics engineering and BI job postings from a European job search, classified each on ten behavioural dimensions using a structured codebook, and derived two falsifiable predictions from management fashion theory before looking at the results. One prediction — that AI-skill hiring criteria would lag survey-claimed adoption and cluster in structurally-motivated roles — held up directionally (83% of JDs expect no AI skill from the candidate, against the survey's 72% daily-use claim). The other — that rigour framing would track real organisational risk more than vendor-adoption signals — did not: rigour language is close to flat (79–85%) across domain risk, tool stack, and JD-authorship sophistication, a pattern more consistent with an institutionalised norm than a locally-calibrated response.

Getting to that result required finding and fixing a bug in my own evidence-verification tooling — a check that flagged 391 LLM-cited quotes as hallucinated, when 74% of those "failures" were real evidence synthesised across multiple JD bullets that a naive substring match couldn't recognise as legitimate. That bug, and fixing it, is a better demonstration of what "testing your own codebook" actually looks like than anything that worked on the first try.

This talk covers what the 123 JDs show, what a genuinely falsifiable prediction looks like when it fails, and what broke in the methodology along the way.

**Talk structure (25 minutes):**
- 0–3 min: What revealed-preference data is and why it's different from a survey
- 3–8 min: Four years of dbt report narrative — each year's anxiety, each year's product
- 8–13 min: The two predictions, derived from management fashion theory, before the data
- 13–19 min: What the data actually showed — one prediction supported, one not, and why the non-result matters
- 19–23 min: What broke in the tooling — the evidence-verifier bug, the CSV dedup bug, and what fixing them changed
- 23–25 min: What this means if you're writing the JD or applying to one; the dataset is open
