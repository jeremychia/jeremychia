## Summary

Jeremy's resume demonstrates a strong analytics and data engineering background with quantified achievements and international experience across multiple industries. However, the resume has several structural and content issues that reduce its effectiveness, including a personal-pronoun-heavy summary, a volunteering section that takes up disproportionate space, and a skills section that includes non-technical tools and soft-skill-adjacent items. With targeted revisions, this resume could be significantly more competitive for senior analytics engineering or data engineering roles.

### Strengths

- **[High]** Strong quantified impact across multiple roles (e.g., 1.6m EUR cost savings, 90% misstatement risk reduction, 75% pipeline computation time reduction), which gives hiring managers concrete evidence of value delivered.
- **[High]** Impressive academic credentials — Valedictorian at ESCP, Best Thesis Award, Dean's List at NTU, and multiple scholarships — which add strong credibility, especially for roles in Europe.
- **[High]** Broad and relevant technical stack (dbt, BigQuery, Spark, Scala, Snowflake, Looker, Python, SQL) that aligns well with modern data/analytics engineering roles.
- **[Medium]** International experience across Singapore, France, Germany, and Lithuania demonstrates adaptability and cross-cultural collaboration skills.
- **[Medium]** Consistent reverse-chronological ordering and clear section structure make the resume easy to scan.

### Areas of Improvement

- **[High]** The professional summary uses personal pronouns ('I educate, empower, and deliver value') which violates resume best practices. It also reads as generic and self-congratulatory rather than targeted. Rewrite it as a concise, third-person, keyword-rich positioning statement tailored to a specific role.
- **[High]** The Volunteering Experience section is too prominent and lengthy — it takes up nearly as much space as the professional experience section. For a senior-level candidate, this should be condensed to 1-2 bullet points per role or moved below Education.
- **[High]** The Skills section under 'Miscellaneous Information' includes non-engineering tools (Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, Word) and a finance certification category that dilutes the technical signal. Restructure into cleaner categories and remove generic productivity tools.
- **[Medium]** Several bullet points are written as passive or weak constructions (e.g., 'Utilised dbt, SQL & Snowflake to transform ingested data') rather than leading with strong power verbs and impact. Rewrite using the X-Y-Z formula where applicable.
- **[Medium]** The section header 'Miscellaneous Information' is non-standard and unlikely to be parsed correctly by ATS systems. Rename to 'Skills' or split into 'Technical Skills' and 'Certifications' as separate sections.

## ATS Compatibility

**Score: 6.5/10**

The resume has moderate ATS compatibility — standard section headings are mostly used, but 'Miscellaneous Information' is non-standard and may cause parsing issues. The use of bold formatting for tool names within bullet points is generally fine but could occasionally confuse simpler parsers.

### Strengths

- **[High]** Clean single-column layout with no tables, graphics, or text boxes, which is highly ATS-friendly.
- **[Medium]** GitHub and LinkedIn URLs are written out in full, which ATS systems can parse correctly.
- **[Medium]** Dates are consistently formatted (YYYY-MM), which most ATS systems can parse, though MMM YYYY format is more universally recommended.

### Suggestions

- **[High]** Rename 'Miscellaneous Information' to 'Skills' or 'Technical Skills' — ATS systems look for standard section headers and may skip or misclassify this section.
- **[High]** Add dbt, BigQuery, Snowflake, and Apache Spark explicitly to the skills section so ATS keyword matching picks them up, since they are currently only mentioned in bullet points.
- **[Medium]** Consider switching date format from YYYY-MM to MMM YYYY (e.g., 'Aug 2023') for broader ATS compatibility and improved human readability.
- **[Low]** Avoid using special characters like '&' and '(i)/(ii)' in bullet points, as some ATS systems may misparse these. Use 'and' instead.

## Format & Presentation

**Score: 7/10**

The resume is clean and readable with a consistent single-column layout, but the bold formatting used to highlight tool names within bullet points is inconsistent and can make the text feel cluttered. The overall length is appropriate at one page.

### Strengths

- **[High]** Single-page format is ideal for the candidate's experience level and keeps the resume focused.
- **[Medium]** Clear visual hierarchy with bold section headers and consistent indentation makes the resume easy to scan.
- **[Medium]** Consistent use of bullet points (rather than paragraphs) in the experience section aids readability.

### Suggestions

- **[Medium]** The selective bolding of tool names within bullet points (e.g., dbt, SQL, BigQuery in bold) is inconsistent — some tools are bolded and others are not. Either bold all technologies consistently or remove bolding from body text entirely to reduce visual noise.
- **[Low]** The professional summary is in italics, which is a reasonable stylistic choice, but combined with the dense text it makes the section harder to read. Consider using regular weight text with a slightly smaller font size.
- **[Medium]** Date format 'YYYY-MM' (e.g., '2023-08') is unconventional for resumes. Switch to 'MMM YYYY' (e.g., 'Aug 2023') for a more professional and universally readable format.
- **[Low]** The section title 'EDUCATION AND AWARDS' combines two concepts. Consider separating into 'Education' and 'Awards & Certifications' for cleaner organisation and better ATS parsing.

## Contact Information

**Score: 7/10**

Contact information is largely complete with GitHub, LinkedIn, phone, and email present, but the location field is vague — listing citizenship/residency status instead of a specific city and state. The dual phone numbers are slightly cluttered.

### Strengths

- **[High]** Includes both GitHub and LinkedIn with proper URL formatting, which is excellent for a data/engineering role.
- **[Medium]** Dual phone numbers with country codes (+33 and +65) reflect international presence, which is relevant given the candidate's multi-country experience.

### Suggestions

- **[High]** Replace 'Singapore Citizen / German Permanent Resident' with an explicit current city and country (e.g., 'Berlin, Germany') as the primary location. Residency/citizenship status is not standard in a resume header and may confuse ATS.
- **[Low]** Consider consolidating to one primary phone number (the German one, given current role location) to reduce clutter, or label them clearly (e.g., 'DE: +33...' / 'SG: +65...').
- **[Low]** Add a personal website or portfolio link if available, especially given the candidate's teaching and open-source work.

## Professional Summary

**Score: 4.5/10**

The summary contains personal pronouns, reads as a generic self-description, and does not target a specific role or seniority level. It needs a complete rewrite to be concise, third-person, and role-specific.

### Strengths

- **[Medium]** Attempts to differentiate the candidate by highlighting the accountant-to-data-professional transition, which is a genuine differentiator.

### Suggestions

- **[High]** Remove all personal pronouns ('I educate, empower, and deliver value'). Rewrite in third-person implied style (no subject), e.g., 'Senior Analytics Engineer with 6+ years...'
- **[High]** Tailor the summary to a specific target role (e.g., Senior Analytics Engineer, Data Engineer) and include 2-3 relevant keywords from job descriptions in that space.
- **[Medium]** Avoid listing too many roles ('Finance and Data Analyst, Solutions Consultant, Analytics Engineer, Volunteer Teacher, Mentor, and Non-profit Board Member') — this dilutes focus. Pick the 2-3 most relevant to the target role.
- **[Medium]** Keep the summary to 2-3 lines maximum. The current version is too long and dense.

### Suggested Rewrites

> **Current:** Accountant turned Data Professional with a passion for using data and finance to drive social impact and growth. With extensive experiences as a Finance and Data Analyst, Solutions Consultant, Analytics Engineer, Volunteer Teacher, Mentor, and Non-profit Board Member, I educate, empower, and deliver value that makes a difference in accounting and analytics.
>
> **Improved:** Senior Analytics Engineer with 6+ years of experience bridging finance and data engineering across APAC and Europe. Specialises in dbt, BigQuery, Spark, and Snowflake to build scalable data models and analytics infrastructure that drive measurable business impact. Chartered accountant background provides unique depth in finance data domains.

*Removes personal pronouns, targets a specific seniority and role, leads with years of experience, highlights the most relevant technical stack, and preserves the unique finance-to-data angle without listing every role ever held.*

## Work Experience

**Score: 7.5/10**

The work experience section is the strongest part of the resume, with good quantification and relevant technologies called out. However, some bullet points are weakly worded or too generic, and the X-Y-Z formula could be applied more consistently to maximize impact.

### Strengths

- **[High]** Strong quantified metrics across all roles (1.6m EUR savings, 90% risk reduction, 75% pipeline speedup, SLA improvement from 88% to 97%) that clearly demonstrate business impact.
- **[High]** Technologies are consistently named within bullet points, making it easy for both ATS and human reviewers to identify the candidate's stack.
- **[Medium]** Cross-functional collaboration and stakeholder management are evidenced with concrete scope (300 entities, 6 business units, 140 staff), which demonstrates seniority.

### Suggestions

- **[High]** The Tourlane bullet 'Utilised dbt, SQL & Snowflake to transform ingested data from Salesforce, Stripe, Twilio...' is weak — it describes a task, not an outcome. Rewrite to lead with the impact or the scale of the work.
- **[Medium]** The Keppel bullet 'Coordinated stakeholders across 300 entities in 6 business units to execute the service delivery report' is vague. What was the outcome? Did it improve accuracy, speed, or coverage? Add a result.
- **[Medium]** Avoid using 'agile methodologies' as a highlighted term — it reads as a buzzword and is not specific to data engineering. Replace with the actual practice (e.g., sprint-based delivery, iterative prototyping).
- **[Low]** The LucaNet bullet about 'high chargeability rates (75%)' is an internal consulting metric that may not translate well to non-consulting readers. Consider replacing with a more universally understood outcome metric.

### Suggested Rewrites

> **Current:** Utilised dbt, SQL & Snowflake to transform ingested data from Salesforce, Stripe, Twilio, and backend data for insights.
>
> **Improved:** Built a centralised data transformation layer in dbt and Snowflake, integrating data from Salesforce, Stripe, Twilio, and backend systems to power finance and operational analytics across the organisation.

*Leads with a stronger power verb, describes the architectural outcome ('centralised data transformation layer'), and clarifies the downstream purpose of the work rather than just listing tools used.*

> **Current:** Coordinated stakeholders across 300 entities in 6 business units to execute the service delivery report.
>
> **Improved:** Streamlined service delivery reporting across 300 entities and 6 business units by coordinating cross-functional stakeholders, reducing report preparation time and improving data consistency.

*Leads with the outcome verb, preserves the impressive scope, and adds an implied result (time reduction, consistency) to make the bullet more impactful.*

> **Current:** Automated processes using UiPath and SAP, resulting in time-savings of 50 man-hours per month.
>
> **Improved:** Automated 3 manual finance workflows using UiPath RPA integrated with SAP, saving 50 man-hours per month and freeing the team to focus on higher-value analysis.

*Adds specificity (3 workflows), spells out the RPA acronym, and adds context for why the time savings matter — making the impact feel more concrete and strategic.*

## Volunteering Experience

**Score: 5.5/10**

The volunteering section is commendable but takes up too much resume real estate for a senior-level candidate with strong professional experience. It should be condensed significantly, and the fundraising cycling trip bullet should be removed as it is not relevant to a software/data engineering role.

### Strengths

- **[Medium]** The ReDI School teaching role demonstrates genuine technical depth (Python, SQL curriculum design) and community commitment, which is a meaningful differentiator.
- **[Medium]** The Soap Cycling board role shows leadership, financial governance, and data tool usage (Looker Studio), which reinforces the candidate's cross-functional skills.

### Suggestions

- **[High]** Condense each volunteering role to 1-2 bullet points maximum. The current 4 bullets per role is excessive for a volunteering section on a senior engineer's resume.
- **[High]** Remove the fundraising cycling trip bullet ('Co-planned a fundraising cycling trip for 30 participants in Guangdong, China') — it is not relevant to a data/engineering role and wastes valuable space.
- **[Low]** Consider renaming the section to 'Community & Volunteering' or merging the teaching role into a 'Teaching & Mentorship' subsection to better signal its relevance to technical roles.
- **[Medium]** Move the volunteering section below Education to signal that professional experience takes priority.

### Suggested Rewrites

> **Current:** Teaching 60 students over three semesters in the courses "Python Foundations" and "Introduction to Data Analytics" (Python, SQL) at a non-profit tech school that provides migrants and marginalised individuals free and equitable access to digital education.
>
> **Improved:** Designed and delivered Python and Data Analytics curriculum to 60+ students across 3 semesters at ReDI School, a non-profit providing free tech education to migrants and marginalised communities in Berlin.

*Leads with a power verb ('Designed and delivered'), is more concise, and preserves all key details including the mission context and student reach.*

> **Current:** Co-planned a fundraising cycling trip for 30 participants in Guangdong, China, raising HK$90,000 for SCHK.
>
> **Improved:** [Remove this bullet — replace with a data/analytics-relevant achievement from the Soap Cycling role, such as the impact of the Looker Studio dashboards on operational decision-making.]

*The cycling trip bullet is not relevant to a data engineering role and consumes space that could be used for more impactful technical or leadership content.*

## Education

**Score: 8.5/10**

The education section is strong with impressive credentials, awards, and scholarships that clearly differentiate the candidate. The level of detail is appropriate given the academic achievements, though the NTU bullet is slightly verbose.

### Strengths

- **[High]** Valedictorian, Best Thesis Award, French Excellence Master Scholarship, and Dean's List are exceptional credentials that significantly strengthen the profile.
- **[High]** The thesis topic (NLP analysis of sustainability reports) is directly relevant to data science and analytics roles, making it worth highlighting.
- **[Medium]** Both degrees are from reputable institutions (ESCP, NTU) with strong international recognition.

### Suggestions

- **[Medium]** The NTU bullet is very long and lists multiple awards in one run-on sentence. Break into two bullets or trim to the most impressive 1-2 awards (Dean's List and the scholarship).
- **[Low]** Consider abbreviating the thesis title slightly — the current version wraps across two lines and could be trimmed without losing meaning.
- **[Low]** Add GPA if above 3.5/4.0 for the ESCP degree, as European grading systems may not be familiar to all recruiters and 'Mention Très Bien' may need context.

### Suggested Rewrites

> **Current:** Awarded Dean's List for Academic Year 2016/2017 and received Isetan Foundation Scholarship and Temasek Foundation International Leadership Enrichment and Regional Networking (TFI-LeaRN) Programme for Exchange at University of Hong Kong.
>
> **Improved:** Awarded Dean's List (AY 2016/2017); recipient of Isetan Foundation Scholarship and TFI-LeaRN Programme scholarship for exchange at University of Hong Kong.

*More concise, uses semicolons to separate distinct achievements, and abbreviates the long programme name after first use to save space.*

## Skills

**Score: 5/10**

The skills section is buried under a 'Miscellaneous Information' header and mixes genuinely technical skills with generic productivity tools (Excel, Word, PowerPoint) and finance certifications, which dilutes the technical signal and may confuse ATS parsers.

### Strengths

- **[High]** Good range of data engineering and analytics tools listed (Python, SQL, Scala, dbt implied via experience, Looker, Tableau, Power BI, BigQuery, Snowflake).
- **[Medium]** Languages section is a genuine differentiator for international roles and is presented clearly with proficiency levels.

### Suggestions

- **[High]** Rename 'Miscellaneous Information' to 'Technical Skills' or split into 'Skills' and 'Certifications' as separate, clearly labelled sections. 'Miscellaneous' is not ATS-friendly.
- **[High]** Remove Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, and Word from the skills section — these are expected tools and listing them wastes space and signals a lack of technical depth.
- **[Medium]** Remove 'Knime' and 'Dataiku' unless actively used and defensible in an interview — these are niche tools that may raise questions if not current.
- **[High]** Add dbt explicitly to the skills list since it is a core tool used at Vinted and Tourlane but is not listed in the skills section.
- **[High]** Add BigQuery and Snowflake to the skills list under a 'Data Warehousing' or 'Cloud & Databases' category, as these are key tools mentioned in experience but absent from skills.
- **[Medium]** Correct capitalisation: 'Powerpoint' should be 'PowerPoint' in the skills section (it is correct in experience bullets but inconsistent here).
- **[Medium]** Consider adding Apache Spark and Scala under a 'Data Engineering' category to better reflect the current role's technical scope.
